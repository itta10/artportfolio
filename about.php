    <p>
      Hey!  You might be well aware of my name by now! Anyway I am Shreyshi, a sixteen year old digital illustrator and graphic designer.Other than that I also study Biology.
      I hail from Dehradun,India. I wish to study graphic drsigning after I complete my schooling. I think I might as well start a small shop for myself but for now it's judt a mere thought.
      <br> <br> Art is something that gives me the sense of belongingness. I started off by doing little sketches in pencil as a kid and then covid knocked the world down. The whole lockdown brought the opportunity
      to enhance my skills, that's when I bought a little writing pad to start of with my illustration journey. It took me sometime to  get a hold of it.i I have been
      freelancing and have did some work for some local buisnesses.<br> <br>

      Well now I have a tablet to illustrate on and I wish to explore the domain throughout. Art is something I enjoy doing and I don't really think there is anything
      that I really like more than this. I love creating things and giving life to what I draw.
